<div class="Mything">
  <p align="center">
    <center>I was originally born in Australia which entitles me to have lived here my entire life pretty much.  However, my cultural background and heritage lies in Greece where my ancestors were born and migrated to Australia during the era of 1940â€™s mainly to escape from war. My parents were also born in Australia but influenced by the orthodox religion as that is what the Greeks have believed in for many centuries. As you probably already know I do in fact speak Greek and understand the language but am not as fluent as my parents are, as they grew up with the Greek language with their parents more than I have 10 times over.</center</p>

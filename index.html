      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h4>What I look like</h4>

        <div class="meimg">
          <img src="Me.jpg" alt:"Photo of Me" style="height:400px;">
        </div>
    <p align="justify">My Name is Alexander Koulis. I am 19 Years old and I was born in Carlton, Victoria, which makes me Australian. However, my cultural background and heritage lies in Greece where my grandparents were born and immigrated to Australia during the early 1960’s mainly to escape from lack of jobs and poverty. Both my parents were born in Australia, the first-generation children of Greek immigrants but influenced by The Greek Orthodox Religion has been maintained here, as well as cultural traditions that have been kept alive wherever Greeks move to over the centuries. As you probably already know I do in fact speak Greek and understand the language, but I am not as fluent as my parents are, as they grew up with the Greek language with their parents more than I have 10 times over.</p>

    <h3>More Information About Me</h3>

    <p align="justify">I have completed VCE (Year 12) at Emmanual College, Altona North in 2021. My subjects were: English 3/4, Further Mathematics 3/4, Psychology 3/4, Software Development (Applied Computing) 3/4, VET Sport and Recreation 3/4. Including a bit of CISCO networking in Year 10. We do own a pet cat who has been named “Zorba”. The reason for his chosen name is the famous film character, Zorba the Greek. I loved sport, having played several sports, even attaining a brown belt in Karate. I turned back to playing soccer for just over 8 years which I was very skillful at, however, when Covid appeared it made me lose my motivation to continue playing and all my sporting activities just stopped which had developed more into my gaming passion.</p>

    <h3>Interesting Facts About Me</h3>

    <p align="justify">One interesting fact that I barely even talk about is the high investment of my time into video gaming but not just in today’s world. I used to play the good ol’ classics that started the journey. I just stumbled upon it, I was just a casual player, enjoying the time, figuring out the little mechanics back on the old Nintendo DS. I used to love grabbing the small cards and inserting them into the Nintendo DS to play Pokémon Silver/Gold and plenty more of my childhood favourites, like Mario Kart, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare and Super Mario 64.</p>

    <h4>Here is a picture of me at the age of 4 playing a computer game</h4>

    <div class="meimg">
      <img src="4_Year_Old_Alex.JPG" alt:"Photo of me as a Kid" style="height:400px;">
    </div>
    <p align="justify">With a passion for video games, this has matured and developed over many years of development of advanced hardware and software to run more texturized and more quality visuals in today’s world of gaming. I used to be a great casual console player on the PlayStation 4. My favourite game has to be Horizon Zero Dawn, it was a massive open-world exploration game, it had an amazing post-apocalyptic visual world, where fabricated machines (dinosaurs) were programmed to prolong the Earth’s life by using a computer program called GAIA. </p>

    <p align="justify">This storyline had many possible paths for the player like doing side quest for extra content or generally just focusing on the main story which I absolutely loved. Depending on what the player chose in the dialogue options, the player changed the directions and paths of the game. The overall ending being wasn't impacted too much but still leading to the climatic ending. With my interests today focused on gaming experiences, I am currently playing the mainstream games, such as Valorant, Fortnite, Overwatch, Rocket League and many more. I have played more competitively with other players in recent times, making gaming a more intense experience with others on a team or even solo. </p>

    <h2>Personal Profile - Personality Traits</h2>
    <div class="meimg">
    <img src="Results.jpg" alt:"Personality Trait" style="height:500px;">
  </div>
    <p align="justify">My general opinion towards these tests is that it does give me an idea of what my personality may look like and insight into others who might have these hidden traits about them that I never knew before. This can also provide me with knowledge in understanding myself for when I am being part of group work. Using this test. can lead to self-development however, there is a part of me that also disagrees with some of the test results as a whole. For example, in the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality">Myers-Briggs (16personalities.com) test.</a> I agree to an extent has results that I believe is that I am a bit more introverted than just 51%. Sometimes I do tend to not say a lot to many people around me as I am just a quiet person in general but when I talk about something I'm enthusiastic about I do tend to say a lot. As stated on their website as a Mediator I long for deeply meaningful relationships. </p>
    <p align="justify">The phrase taken from this Website “This personality type makes up such a small portion of the population, Mediators may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique” has enabled me to fully understand myself. This statement I can relate to, as I believe that I am not noticed by many people in the world around me however I do want to impress and excel myself to be something a bit more in the world. As one of my strengths, being an Open-Minded person without judgement is exactly what I believe is one of the correct traits I have. It is explained that “Mediators try not to judge anyone else’s beliefs, lifestyles, or decisions."
      <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality">(“16personalities - Myrna E. Flores Professor Nagy UNI  ” </a>
      Mediators often become confidants for their friends and loved ones – and occasionally for total strangers
      <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-strengths-and-weaknesses>">(“Strengths & Weaknesses | Mediator (INFP) Personality”).</a> </p>
    <p align="justify"> Not only can I relate to this, but I do also fully accept anyone as much as possible no matter their decisions in life and judging people is hard to come by as you never know what someone has gone through to make tough decisions and change their lifestyle. </p>

        <div class="main">
            <h2>First interests in I.T</h2>
            <p align="justify">My interest in I.T began with my first good old laptop back in primary school. You would get these “amazing” laptops that you would make life much easier as a learning tool and would make it easier to organize documents instead of flipping through pages in a book or finding a paper document within other documents, all piled up. No wonder you can’t find anything among the clutter. I didn’t know how useful a computer can be and so started to learn more about I.T. The software tools that could be used just inspired me. I came to learn how hardware and software used to interconnect with each other and how the user interfaces were made. </p>

              <p align="justify">I believe my own curiosity has inspired me to investigate into the I.T industry and by looking forward to new and improved technology, such as networking from computer to worldwide servers, cloud saving speeds and many more topics within sub-topics etc. Being able to save anything on the internet and being able to retrieve it back again is a lifesaver if anything were to happen to the user’s computer data or files. One can easily retrieve files and quickly continue working on documents almost uninterrupted through Google’s suites of Apps, like Google Word Document for example. I also feel in this era and with worlds technology that we can never feel too safe with passwords protecting our data and that it is vital to protect our personal information from others. I chose RMIT as my first preference placement in higher education.</p>

              <p align="justify">I couldn’t explain how excited I felt when I was accepted into my chosen course at RMIT. I felt a burst of energy rush through me. I felt I would be able to find myself as a person and also find a potential career within the I.T industry, expand my overall knowledge and be able to do something useful for the world. The classes have had similar content to what I have learned as a year 12 student, which has made the course material easier to understand. </p>

              <p align="justify">I have given myself the expectation of learning how to be more independent throughout my life as that is the most important factor that plays into studying and being organized at RMIT. Not only do I get to learn more about independence, but this will provide me with an opportunity to meet and create new friends. Around campus I would want my independence to help increase my learning ability, to ask for help and to possibly help my peers with their studies, if they need help and support.</p>
              <h2>My Ideal Job - <a href="https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/army/cyber-specialist">Cyber Specialist</a></h2>
              <p align="justify">The position for such a role in the defence force will provide me with the knowledge of defending networks from enemies who wish to disrupt the communication systems. The battlefield will not be on the ground but more like fighting behind the scenes, on networks. This ideal job would require me to learn how to defend our systems from cyber threats and intercept enemy communications that can possibly gain intel to support the entire operation. This does intrigue me as I wish to learn more about cybersecurity and how to better  defend our networks from threats. I feel a need to be part of those that are willing to protect this country.</p>
              <p align="justify">With no prior experience, I'll be able to do on the job training to operate the advanced technology. You will gain a highly desirable skillset to set you up for a future career in the military and beyond. The Australian Defence Force requires me to have quick problem solving skills and seek the challenge of working within a constantly evolving environment.</p>

              <p align="justify">This position would have flexibility in what paths could be taken, or the ability to specialize in very specific areas, all the main purpose of increasing one’s skillset with more demanding training and experience. With already completed Year 12, I have already completed the prerequisites for this course which is Math and English after Year 10. There are options to take a GAP year to enjoy some experience and not commit yourself into 12+ months as they will give the necessary training to know the basics of this opportuninty.</p>

              <h1>Project Idea</h1>
              <h2>Video Game Organiser - Product Name: Gamers Heaven</h2>
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p align="justify"> As a PC gamer, I find it difficult to find the right game to play amongst so many different shortcut icons unsorted, messy and even sometimes too small to read text on steam. Many gamers themselves are frustrated by having to switch between numerous game providers in order to locate the right game to play. <br> <br>
              The idea of a video game organiser came to mind to cater for casual and experienced video game (PC) players. I would aggregate all video gaming engines and platforms exclusive to PC content as consoles already have this feature within their built-in games library only which is the downside for PC gamers having this tool at their fingertips. All of these configurations could be found in my organiser. When you link your accounts to this software, the games you own will be sorted under your own umbrella and there will be many different navigation options for when you want to buy a new game or organise your games by most hours played or alphabetical order for those who want quick access to their content.</p>
              <h3>Motivation</h3>
              <p align="justify">This gaming organisation tool will surely increase productivity as well as the overall quality of life aspects. A non-Steam game, such as Overwatch or Call of Duty Vanguard, may be imported into Steam software to launch however, this merely opens the launcher, making it cumbersome for the gamers to click the play button again if they would like to get right into the action. This would not only allow for more quick launching capabilities, but it will also allow for more personalisation for individuals who want to show off their games to their friends. Similarly to their collection of disc-based games for consoles as means to boast all over their friends!</p>
              <h3>Description</h3>
              <p align="justify">The features that will be included in this game organiser would be what any unorganised person would ever want. It would import all existing games a user owns and would display them on a menu selection screen. Like the GeForce Experience software, it would scan folders within your Program Files as a default setting. With multiple other drives and folders, you may have can provide the directory for the software to find those games you have installed. Also, as you launch the game it will also open up the launcher in the background that the game must use. Overall, an efficient one-click play button would load up all your saved settings you’ve already entered. To reduce the number of clicks and misclick attempts, the program will also inform you of what is currently being executed such as multiple game updates or if you’re downloading a new game. </p>

              <p align="justify">The software would automatically check the server for any potential updates to ensure that you have the latest version installed and the service will provide you with the latest news (patch notes, events, etc). With one click, on a chosen game, it would provide you with all the relevant information before you press start to play. Not only would it search the games you have already installed but it will also (try) find games with the most hours played, as this would form another category sorter. The program will automatically sort the last played game, most populated game with the current players in your server region and in alphabetical order. Additionally in these games, it would also track your configured settings and will give you the choice to change them within the menu. </p>

              <p align="justify">The most difficult part of this project would be to allow the major game providers to advertise their content on my software. They would be allowed to have a separate section for their promotions of current or new games on the navigation bar named “Games Store." For the time being, the user would have to use this program to open up the launcher for the preferred game or from the web on the store page (open launcher). Cooperating with many different game companies would provide the greatest challenge, on the ease of use for the players to browse all stores within one software page.</p>

              <p align="justify">Currently, players would have to browse many game stores with their own specific services to find new games to try and or buy. However, if this were to be implemented, given enough time and communication with other companies to allow authorisation of their products and services, it could make consumers more likely to explore all video game genres and game creators all in one place.</p>

              <p align="justify">Our current system for custom-built PCs and even pre-built PCs, including the generic gaming laptop, can have optimized gameplay with a tuning feature. For those with Geforce Graphic Card and AMD graphic cards, you would have the same options for optimizing gameplay. You don’t need to worry about manually configuring it yourself all you have to do is click “optimize”. There would be an optimization feature that would allow you to adjust via a slider for whether you prefer quality over performance, for example. This would implement user preferences and could be disabled with a checkbox in the settings menu if you do not like optimizing your gameplay or if you prefer using your own way of optimizing gameplay. It would be completely customizable to the user and will be always pushing for more personalised options.</p>

              <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>

              <p align="justify">There would be a recommended configuration requirement for both the hardware and software. For hardware, they would need a GeForce Graphics Card installed or an AMD Graphics Card for the importance of game performance options. This does not mean you can’t have a different GPU but only a recommendation if you wish to have the best optimisation. As well as the minimum of at least 8-16 GB of RAM. The CPU should be Intel I5 6th Gen and newer and/or equivalent. There is no absolute maximum storage as this is limitless to the user's preference but a minimum for gamers would at least be 250GBs.<br>
              <p align="justify">The software side is intended for a library of games, but will not have such a large file size as the software is meant to be only for grabbing games already installed so there is no need to worry about any storage issues. The GPU drivers would have to be installed including being logged into your accounts. This allows for smooth transitions into gameplay rather than having to sign in every time you launch an application like Epic Games. </p>
              <h3>Outcome</h3>
              <p align="justify">The original problem of sorting out different games in different launchers does make it difficult for users as well as manage different shortcuts on a desktop home screen as it increases the visual clutter. Icons that are not needed would go and it would give gamers less of a headache from sorting games that aren’t even installed be on their game's library. The outcome of the game organiser would be to provide a more efficient, more capable, less user input launcher that would be more compatible with most games to this day.</p>
              <p align="justify">The importance of this development of this software would make life less of a hassle for users for a clear overview section that would display current games downloaded and those yet to be downloaded. Having to organize their own system in regard to what content is seen and that which is hidden. This could even be used for gamers who wish to showcase their massive game collection to other players or friends or on social media.</p>
              <p align="justify"> The issues and questions that comes into mind that I have considered looking into is that: Would gamers even want this software? Do they want a one-page overview of their game software investment? Well, of course! It’s a customizability feature that would allow every gamer to choose how this program/software looks and create their own theme at the user's discretion. Furthermore, it provides services that aren’t even implemented yet on other platforms which can instantly load up any game of their choosing without the need to choose to use the launcher to confirm the game they are playing. This will be hidden away in the background, so the user doesn’t have to provide more input again for a game they already chose to be confirmed again with the launcher.</p>
              <p align="justify">Another issue that was brought into the picture is why use hardware optimization within the software when there is already GPU optimization software and drivers? Being able to already optimize your game is already implemented when the game is not running. However, the reason for integrating these software options and capabilities is to allow a more diverse range of options for the user. Optimizing gameplay is the most crucial factor for gamers as they don’t want to deal with recommended settings that are sometimes offered by the PC system itself that will give them terrible frames per second and even slow down the computer.</p>
              <p align="justify">With more resources being inputted into the game itself, gamers would also want enough power to run simple programs like their web browser for a second monitor. They don’t have to include their GPU hardware and software into this program when they first download the game organiser. If they wish to, there will be an option for that which again comes back to the idea of the user having preferences.</p>

      <h4 style="text-align:center">What I look like</h4>

    <p>I was born in Carlton, Victoria, which makes me Australian. However, my cultural background and heritage lies in Greece where my grandparents were born and immigrated to Australia during the early 1960’s mainly to escape from lack of jobs and poverty. Both my parents were born in Australia, the first generation children of Greek immigrants but influenced by the Greek Orthodox religion and a retained culture that has followed Greeks wherever they move to many centuries. As you probably already know I do in fact speak Greek and understand the language but I am not as fluent as my parents are, as they grew up with the Greek language with their parents more than I have 10 times over.</p>

    <h3>More Information About Me</h3>

    <p>I have completed my highest education which was Year 12 at Emmanuel College VCE in 2021 with my subjects being English, Further Maths, Psychology, Software Development (Applied Computing), VET Sport and Recreation and also a bit of CISCO networking in Year 10. We do own a pet cat who has been named “Zorba”. The reason for his chosen name is the famous film character, Zorba the Greek. I loved sport, having played several sports, even attaining a brown belt in Karate. I turned back to playing soccer for just over 8 years which I was very skilful at, however, when Covid appeared it made me lose my motivation to continue playing and all my sporting activities just stopped which had developed more into my gaming passion.</p>

    <h3>Interesting Facts About Me</h3>

    <p>One interesting fact that I barely even talk about is the high investment of my time into video gaming but not just in today’s world. I used to play the good ol’ classics that started the journey. I just stumbled upon it, I was just a casual player, enjoying the time, figuring out the little mechanics back on the old Nintendo DS. I used to love grabbing the small cards and inserting them into the Nintendo DS to play Pokemon Silver/Gold and plenty more of my childhood favourites, like Mario Kart, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare and Super Mario 64.</p>

    <p>With a passion for video games, this has matured and developed over many years of development of advanced hardware and software to run more texturized and more quality visuals in today’s world of gaming. I used to be a great casual console player on the Playstation 4. My favourite game has to be Horizon Zero Dawn, it was a massive open-world exploration game, it had an amazing post-apocalyptic visual world, where man-made machines (dinosaurs) were programmed to prolong the Earth’s life by using a computer program. </p>

    <p>This storyline had many possible paths for the player like doing sidequest for extra content or generally just focusing on the main story which I abosolutely loved. Depending on what the player chose in the dialogue options, the player changed the directions and paths of the game. The overall ending being wasn't impacted too much but still leading to the climatic ending. With my interests today focused on gaming experiences, I am currently playing the mainstream games, such as Valorant, Fortnite, Overwatch, Rocket League and many more. I have played more competitively with other players in recent times, making gaming a more intense experience with others on a team or even solo. </p>

            <h2>First interests in I.T</h2>
              <p>My interest in I.T began with my first good old laptop back in primary school. You would get these “amazing” laptops that you would make life much easier as a learning tool and would make it easier to organize documents instead of flipping through pages in a book or finding a paper document within other documents, all piled up. No wonder you can’t find anything among the clutter. I didn’t know how useful a computer can be and so started to learn more about I.T. The software tools that could be used just inspired me. I came to learn how hardware and software used to interconnect with each other and how the user interfaces were made. </p>

              <p>I believe my own curiosity has inspired me to look into the I.T industry and by looking forward to new and improved technology, such as networking from computer to worldwide servers, cloud saving speeds and many more topics within sub-topics etc. Being able to save anything on the internet and being able to retrieve it back again is a lifesaver if anything were to happen to the user’s computer data or files. One can easily retrieve files and quickly continue working on documents almost uninterrupted through Google’s suites of Apps, like Google Word Documentfor example. I also feel in this era and with worlds technology that we can never feel too safe with passwords protecting our data and that it is vital to protect our personal information from others. I chose RMIT as my first preference placement in higher education.</p>

              <p>I couldn’t explain how excited I felt when I was accepted into my chosen course at RMIT. I felt a burst of energy rush through me. I felt I would be able to find myself as a person and also find a potential career within the I.T industry, expand my overall knowledge and be able to do something useful for the world. The classes have had similar content to what I have learned as a year 12 student, which has made the course material easier to understand. </p>

              <p>I have given myself the expectation of learning how to be more independent throughout my life as that is the most important factor that plays into studying and being organized at RMIT. Not only do I get to learn more about independence, but this will provide me with an opportunity to meet and create new friends. Around campus I would want my independence to help increase my learning ability, to ask for help and to possibly help my peers with their studies, if they need help and support.</p>
              <h2>My Ideal Job - <a href="https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/army/cyber-specialist">Cyber Specialist</a> </h2>
              <p> The position for such a role in the defence force will provide me with the knowledge of defending networks from enemies who wish to disrupt the communication for operations. The battlefield will not be on the ground, more like fighting behind the scenes. This Ideal Job requires me to learn how to defend cyber threats and intercept enemy communications that can possibly gain intel to support the entire operation. This does intrigue me as I wish to learn more about cybersecurity and how to better defend our networks from threats more so in defence force fashion as Australia is in need of those willing to protect the country.</p>

              <p>The position is very flexible in what other paths you can be prompted to if you wish to further increase your skillset with more demanding experience. With already completed Year 12 as the prerequisite is Maths and English after year 10 doesn’t really matter as there are options to take a GAP year to enjoy some experience and not commit yourself 12+ months as it's to give you an idea and training to know the basics of this opportunity.</p>

              <h2>Personal Profile - Personality Traits</h2>
              <p>My general opinion towards these tests is that it does give me an idea of what my personality may look like and also insight into others who might have these hidden traits about them that I never knew before. This can also provide me with knowledge in understanding myself for when I am being part of group work. Using this test. can lead to self-development however, there is a part of me that also disagrees with some of the test results as a whole. For example, in the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality">Myers-Briggs (16personalities.com) test.</a> I agree to an extent has results that I believe is that I am a bit more introverted than just 51%. Sometimes I do tend to not say a lot to many people around me as I am just a quiet person in general but when I talk about something I'm passionate about I do tend to say a lot. As stated on their website as a Mediator I long for deeply meaningful relationships. </p>
